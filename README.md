  Given the data, we are able to conclude that the most successful industries to invest into are theater, music and film & video. Within those, specifically plays, rock music, and documentaries. We are also able to achieve the most success in the summer time. Most budgets given are between $1,000 and $10,000, but are typically more successful with higher budgets like $15-$25,000 or even $30-35,000.

  Some limitations of this dataset is not knowing the time requirements for the different campaigns. Some may have had more opportunity to have a success, where some may have had only a short amount (partly because of budget) which led to faiure.

  Creating a chart for the amount pledged in comparison to the goal would be another great chart to look at. It would provide more insight into why some campaigns are more successful than others.
